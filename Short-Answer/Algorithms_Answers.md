Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

a)
    time complexity = O(n): if n is negative it will create infinite loop, if non-negative number it will run based on the size of n ex: if n = 5, count runs 5 times. if n = 125, count runs 125 times.
b)

    O(n) recursively decreases bunnies by a constant
c)

    O(n) recursively decreases bunnies by a constant

exercise 2:

    I would use a binary search algorithm.
    i would start in the middle building and drop the egg,  
    if it breaks i would go the bottom floor and my previous middle
    if it doesnt break i will go to the floor in the middle of my previous middle and the top.
    repeat this until i have 1 floor.
